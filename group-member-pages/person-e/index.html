      <p>Yusuf Akinpelu loves crime… in books and in movies. He also loves studying how these crimes are solved and telling stories about them. This was why he gave up the desire to be a detective for the life of a journalist, and he now follows the money.</p>
      <p>The journalism graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, worked as a West and Central Africa reporter and producer at the BBC and as a data lead at Premium Times, Nigeria’s only Pulitzer-winning newspaper. He has won multiple awards, including the Sanlam Financial Journalist of the Year in 2022, when he became the first non-South African to win the award.</p>
